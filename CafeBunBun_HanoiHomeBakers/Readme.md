🧑‍🍳 Persona 1 — HomeBaker
Name (Persona): Mai, 27
Background: Runs HanoiBagelCo with 1–2 friends
Specialty: Bagels, cookies, small-batch breads
Business Type: Small home kitchen, sells wholesale to cafés
Current Channel: Zalo + Facebook + existing café partners

⭐ Motivations (Actual Reality-Based)
- Secure recurring wholesale contracts
She doesn’t want to chase 100 small retail buyers → 1 café with stable weekly orders > 20 random Instagram orders.
- Predictable production
Wholesale lets her plan dough, ingredients, oven time.
- Increase income without opening a shop
Renting a storefront in Hanoi is expensive + risky.
- Avoid inconsistent interactions
She hates time wasted answering Instagram/Zalo questions that don’t lead to purchase.
- Grow brand recognition
Being featured in cafés = indirect marketing.
- Minimize logistics pain
Morning deliveries are tiring → she wants a better system.
